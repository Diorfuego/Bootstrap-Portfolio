                      Hello and welcome, my name is Dior Christian. I am very excited to embark on my web development career and the 
                possibilities that await me. Prior to enrolling in this bootcamp class, I attended Lincoln University, Pa and 
                received a Bachelor of Science in Health Science with a minor in Clinical Psychology. The reason why I changed 
                my profession is because having the proper skills to create and shape websites can really help promote myself 
                as an independent personal trainer and others that may be trying to start their own companies.

                          <h5 class="mt-0">The Future Is Now</h5>
                          Technology is the future and the internet isnâ€™t  slowing down at all, so gathering all of the skills that 
                is needed to create a professional and attractive web page is steady growing by the day. I am very interested 
                to see where this bootcamp will take me, but with hard work, dedication and the right guidance, I personal 
                feel that the web is my template and i am really to build upon it.
